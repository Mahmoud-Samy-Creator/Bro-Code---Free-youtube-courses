            <br>
            <pre>
                We're talking away
                I don't know what I'm to say
                I'll say it anyway
                Today is another day to find you
                Shyin' away
                Oh, I'll be comin' for your love, okay
                
                Take on me
                (Take on me)
                Take me on
                (Take on me)
                I'll be gone
                In a day or two
                
                So needless to say
                I'm odds and ends
                But I'll be stumblin' away
                Slowly learnin' that life is okay
                Say after me
                It's no better to be safe than sorry
                
                Take on me
                (Take on me)
                Take me on
                (Take on me)
                I'll be gone
                In a day or two
                
                All the things that you say, yeah
                Is it life or just to play my worries away?
                You're all the things I've got to remember
                You're shyin' away
                I'll be comin' for you anyway
                
                Take on me
                (Take on me)
                Take me on
                (Take on me)
                I'll be gone
                In a day
                (Take on me)
                (Take on me)
                (Take me on)
                (Take on me)
                I'll be gone
                (Take on me)
                In a day
                (Take me on)
                (Take on me)
                (Take on me)
                (Take on me)
                (Take me on)
                (Take on me)
